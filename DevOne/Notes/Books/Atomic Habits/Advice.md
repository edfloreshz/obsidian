> Spend less time setting goals and more time designing systems to achieve them.

> Goals restrict your happiness, when you fall in love with the process, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.

> A goal-oriented mindset can create a yo-yo effect, after achieving a goal, you revert to your old habits.

> Bad habits repeat themselves not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
