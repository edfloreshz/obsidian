Few best practices listed down here.

- Keep Microservices small enough to stay focused and big enough to add value.
- Always maintain documentation of all services in common place.
- In Microservices, eventual consistency is always regarded as your friend.
- Distribute work with load balancers.
- Each Microservice should have their private data.
- Store data in databases but not in ephemeral service instances.
- Layer your security and do not write your crypto code!
- Aggregation services present on the network boundaries can translate for external work.
